# Hi there, I'm Rithwak Somepalli

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Georgia State University with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, full-stack development, and cloud engineering. I like building practical, research-driven tools — from coevolutionary AI agents to network security utilities — and working across the stack to bring ideas to life.

At a startup, I worked across the codebase, integrating financial APIs, building automated stock-data ingestion pipelines, and helping connect frontend and backend systems. This gave me experience with real-world engineering workflows and collaborative problem-solving.

I'm currently developing my cloud engineering skills and pursuing certifications. I've deployed and scaled compute clusters using PySpark and Ray and worked with distributed jobs on Oracle Cloud.

Outside of software, I play guitar.

## Selected Projects

### Coevolutionary ARL Agent vs EGT Population Research
A research project exploring the interaction between Adversarial Reinforcement Learning agents and Evolutionary Game Theory populations in a simulated stock-market environment. The focus is on agent dynamics, stability, and emergent behaviors under competitive conditions.

### Network Capture and Security Toolkit
A Python-based utility built using Scapy for network discovery, device fingerprinting, port scanning, and traffic monitoring.  
Features include:
- ARP-based network scanning  
- TCP SYN port enumeration  
- ICMP-based host status checks  
- Real-time traffic sniffing and JSON export  

### Digit Recognizer
A handwritten-digit classification system built using a custom neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. Implemented from scratch to deepen understanding of optimization, inference, and model design.

### Cookbook AI
A lightweight application that uses AI models to generate recipe ideas and organize cooking instructions, built in JavaScript.

### Restaurant POS System
A functional POS system created in JavaScript for managing orders, transactions, and staff workflows.

## Cloud & Engineering Interests

I am actively learning and applying cloud technologies, with experience in:

- Virtual machine hosting and deployment  
- PySpark and Ray for distributed compute  
- Oracle Cloud for cluster management  
- API integration for financial data pipelines  
- Basic networking and security tooling  
- Automation and ingestion scripts for analytics environments  

I am currently working toward vendor cloud certifications and strengthening my knowledge in distributed systems, cluster orchestration, and scalable application design.
