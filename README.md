# Hi there, I'm Rithwak Somepalli

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Georgia State University interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, **full-stack development**, and **cloud engineering**. I enjoy building practical and research-driven tools—from coevolutionary AI agents to network-security utilities.

At a startup, I worked across the stack integrating **financial APIs**, building **automated stock-data ingestion scripts**, and connecting **frontend + backend services**. This gave me experience with real engineering workflows, CI/CD patterns, and collaborative development.

I'm currently expanding my cloud skills and working toward certifications. I’ve deployed **distributed compute clusters** using **PySpark** and **Ray**, and I’ve hosted and managed workloads on **Oracle Cloud**. Outside of software, I play guitar.
