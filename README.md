# Hi, I'm Rithwak Somepalli 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Georgia State University focusing on **Artificial Intelligence**, **full-stack development**, and **cloud engineering**. I enjoy building practical, research-driven tools — from coevolutionary AI agents to network security utilities — and working across the stack to bring ideas to life.

I previously worked at a startup integrating financial APIs, building automated stock-data ingestion pipelines, and connecting backend and frontend systems. This gave me experience with real-world engineering workflows and collaborative development.

I'm currently expanding my cloud engineering skills, deploying distributed compute clusters using **PySpark** and **Ray**, and working toward cloud certifications. Outside of software, I play guitar for fun.
